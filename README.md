OpenDataNow
===========

The OpenDataNow project is to create a central repository of scraped data
in convenient formats that everyone can use *right now*, without needing to
write their own screen scrapers.  This repository is managed by a collection
of screen scrapers maintained by the Ottawa open data community through
GitHub.

Why?
----

At one of the Open Data Ottawa events in April, it became apparent that people
working on different projects had all written their own screen scrapers, and
many people had neat ideas but were lacking the data necessary to make them
reality.  Our hope with OpenDataNow is to help the community **spend less time
writing screen scrapers and more time doing awesome stuff**.

Where can I find...
-------------------

- The data: <http://repo.opendatanow.ca/>
- The GitHub repository: <http://github.com/dlitz/opendatanow>
- Open Data Ottawa: <http://www.opendataottawa.ca/>

Is this legal?
--------------

OpenDataNow arose out of discussions at an event organized by [Open Data
Ottawa](http://www.opendataottawa.ca/), a grassroots organization that will be
launching Ottawa's first open data hackfest on April 24, 2010.  Coinciding
with the hackfest, the City of Ottawa will begin releasing their data to the
public in formats suitable for re-use.  The idea is that, eventually, most
city data will be made public in a manner similar to http://data.gov/ in the
U.S.  In the meantime, the community has received permission to scrape City of
Ottawa data ourselves.
